                                <h1>Amblyopia Types </h1>Amblyopia is the medical term for “lazy eye,” which refers to a childhood condition where the vision in one eye fails to develop adequately. This usually affects the child’s ability to see using the weaker eye, meaning they come to rely on their stronger eye.

                                Some examples of the physical eye problems that can cause a lazy eye to develop include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A squint or strabismus, where the weaker eye is orientated upwards, outwards, downwards or inwards of the direction the normal eye is facing</li>

                                <li>One eye may have become cloudy due to the development of a cataract </li>
                                <li>One eyelid may be drooping and partly covering the eye. This is called ptosis </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            </q>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                             <h1>Types of amblyopia</h1> 
                             There are several forms of amblyopia and all of them cause reduced vision in the affected eye. The three types of amblyopia are described below:
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             <h1>Strabismic amblyopia </h1>
                             In this form of amblyopia, a squint develops due to a mismatch between the muscles that support the position of the eyes. The brain effectively “ignores” the eye that is not straight, while the brain relies on the images generated by the stronger eye. Treatment approaches include eye exercises to try and re-train the child’s weak eye muscles and covering the “good” eye with an eye patch to encourage use of the “bad” eye.


                             <br>
                             <h1>Refractive or anisometropic amblyopia </h1>
                             This refers to when the refractive error is greater in one eye than in the other. The brain “turns off” the more far-sighted eye and relies instead on the eye that provides a clearer picture. However, the weaker eye remains straight, meaning the problem may go unnoticed by parents or a GP. Refractive amblyopia may not be identified until the child has a vision test. This condition can be treated with corrective glasses or contact lenses.

                              <br>
                              <br>

   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <h1>Deprivation or occlusion amblyopia
                                </h1>This refers to when one eye is “deprived” of vision due to the development of a blockage such as a cataract. The ocular media becomes opaque, which prevents visual information from reaching the retina and then the brain. This form of amblyopia can affect one or both eyes and needs to be caught early to prevent the child form developing poor vision.

                                The CDC said Tuesday, public health labs across the country using CDC test kits were expected to test up to 75,000 people by the end of the week. That's on top of the nearly 1 million people expected to be tested through commercial labs that were approved
                                for testing by the US Food and Drug Administration over the weekend. Last week, health officials also loosened the guidelines on who should be tested for the virus. The change came after the first confirmed coronavirus
                                case of unknown origin, a patient who wasn't initially tested because they didn't meet existing CDC testing guidelines. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence announced that any American, with a doctor's order, can now be
                                tested. The new CDC criteria calls for "Americans (to) be tested (for coronavirus), no restrictions, subject to doctors' orders," Pence said Tuesday describing the new policy.
